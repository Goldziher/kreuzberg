Subject: Complex Email with Multiple Recipients

This email has complex headers with multiple recipients,
CC and BCC fields, and proper RFC2822 formatting.

It should test the parsing of:
- Multiple To recipients
- CC recipients
- BCC recipients
- Message-ID header
- Properly quoted names in email addresses

The Rust implementation should handle all of these correctly.

Best regards,
Complex Sender
